Travel plan for lifts. This repository contains a Node.js command line program that prints out the travel plan of the lift according to the states of the lift and passengers.

Getting Started

1. git clone 
2. npm install
3. npm run plan path-to-state-file

Prerequisites
1. node.js latest version
2. npm modules

Explaination

1. Started with a basic npm framework for node.js program and setup
2. With the files given, tried out file reading with 'fs' npm module
3. Found out basic parsing modules to get the data in JSON format for further proceedings
4. With that data result, decided to loop it and get status of each passenger and lift.
5. Then made an arrays for easily managing them using different algorithms.
6. Made seperate conditions for each state and lift positions.
7. Combined everything for proper management using all these loops and checks to find the shortest path for each passenger with respect to lift position.
8. Tested the whole process simultaneuosly with console methods and flags.
9. Finally made a snippet to write these results to a file with respect to each state file fed for the praogram.
